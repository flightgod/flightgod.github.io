"I love your badge, I want to make my own, What do you suggest to get started". Yes we get this all the time and I love talking to people about this but man, is that a loaded question or what?! 

I hate to be discouraging or negative but DON’T!! , just kidding.  But really, we have been doing this for a few years and it still feels like we are just getting started, I fully understand that there is more that I don’t know than what I actually know. But lets look back at how we got started and what we needed to "Get Started". 

So one day @networkgeek and I were sitting around and thought, Hey ..we have a few weeks before DefCon, we should make a simple badge like the Darknet badge (https://www.dcdark.net/badge7/index.html) we bought last year .. How hard could it be? I mean heck, I have a solder iron and some solder .. And even a pair of 3rd hands, and a whole basement full of tools, I am sure we have everything we need right? WRONG. Well, not uppercase wrong .. Maybe lowercase. Sure there are a lot of things you want, but did we have everything we needed? Turns out we did, pretty much. Lets break it down, we had:

	• Soldering irons, albeit not very good ones but hey you have to start somewhere
	• Solder, its all the same right?
	• A pair of third Hands
	• A silicon heat resistant mat
	• Some angle clippers (or as I called them back then, Wire Cutters)
	• And assorted tools. 

So, what should you have to get started? Let me break it down here:

	• Soldering Iron - https://amzn.to/2Gdk8tX - This is where you should spend the most that you can afford. Trust me, the Hakko https://amzn.to/2ugSgmf looks expensive but after you use a cheap one, it will be night and day for soldering
	• Solder -  https://amzn.to/2NIRaq4 - Get yourself some good no clean solder. Note that solder with Lead is easier to solder with than without, so make sure to clean up after use.
	• Diagonal cutters - https://amzn.to/2NLrKZ2
	• Tweezers - https://amzn.to/2ugSKc3
	• Silicon Heat resistant Mat - https://amzn.to/2tGQvhY

Now that you have the tools, start using them. And use them correctly. Practice, Practice, Practice (see below). 
There are many learn to solder kits or solder kits out there, get them and get good. (https://www.tindie.com/products/BadgePirates/badgepirates-learn-to-solder-kit/)
