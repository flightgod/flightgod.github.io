title: BSidesKC 2019 SAO
---

In the Spirit of Add-Ons we have used the format of the DC26 #Badge Life Shitty Add On (SAO) Connector on this years BSidesKC 2019 Badge. This is a modified SAO in that we only provided VCC and GND but we also layed out the design so that if you did not get an electronic badge you can solder on a CR2032 holder and Power the SAO port. below you will find the layout of the ports for the SAO and image of it on the BSides Badge.

Don't have an CR2032 Battery Holder like this:[CR2032 Holder](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/linx-technologies-inc/BAT-HLD-001/BAT-HLD-001-ND/1577235) .. no worries, find the Badge Pirates at thier workshop Friday and we will have some, or anytime Saturday.

Lets see those SAO.
